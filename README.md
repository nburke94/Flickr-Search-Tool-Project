# Flickr-Search-Tool-Project
Flickr Search Tool Project Using Flickr API

Create a Flickr Search Tool which takes in tags entered by the user and constructs a search on Flickr. 
Images must be displayed and loaded into a carousel on submit. 
The Flickr API was used to construct the search. 
JQuery and JavaScript proved essential to create the carousel effect on the images once loaded. 
HTML5 and CSS3 were used to display the content and design the layout of the website respectively. 
An exceptional understanding of JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 was obtained on completion of this particular project.
